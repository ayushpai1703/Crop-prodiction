The project on Predictive Modelling for Crop Production utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for forecasting crop production quantities. By leveraging historical data on crop production, cultivation practices, and environmental factors, the model trains a Random Forest Regressor algorithm. Key input variables such as state, year, season, crop type, and cultivation area are considered. Through rigorous preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes, the model achieves high accuracy and reliability in predicting crop production outcomes. Stakeholders can use the user-friendly interface to input parameters and receive real-time predictions for informed decision-making and planning. The model's efficacy is validated against real-world data, highlighting its potential to support sustainable agricultural practices, optimize resource allocation, and enhance food security efforts. This project contributes to the advancement of agricultural analytics by emphasizing data-driven approaches to address challenges within the agricultural sector.
